## Who am I?
I'm John Holbrook. I'm a 50+ year old computer geek living in the most beautiful place in the world - Penticton BC Canada.

I've worked in IT for over 23 years for a local Financial Institution.  I started doing desktop/server/network support. Moved my way up in various roles including (Senior) Network Administrator, Cyber Security Analyst, Cyber Security Manager, Cyber Security Officer and at for the last couple of years IT Governance Manager. I'm missing some titles in the timeline but that's not important.

In Q4 2020, the organization decided to "go in a different direction with governance" and I left. 

Currently doing vCISO work with CyberSC. Loving the work. Focused on vCISO duties for SMB market. 

I'm always open to new opportunities in technology and Cyber Security.
